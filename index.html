      <p>Before I begin to tell you anything about Bhagat Singh, I must give a disclaimer, that this is not all. Yes, because it is surely not possible to confine the valour of this young martyr of ours in just a single article. Presented below are 4 things about him that I felt one must know and remember.</p>
      <ol>
       <li><p id="para">Born in a family of freedom fighters in 1907 in the Punjab province of the British era India, Bhagat Singh had the recipe ready at home to become one himself. Given the environment at his home, he was never going to stay silent against the atrocities of the British. Their cruel and cunning deeds unfolding with time, gradually evolved the leader within him.</p></li>
       <li><p id="para">As many say, he inspired a whole generation with his grit, determination, focus and fearlessness. He was not one to be drifted away by popular opinions, he did what he felt was right for the situation. One instance of this can be seen in his participation in the Non-cooperation movement. He had joined it with enthusiasm but the death of some villagers involved in it made him reconsider his decision. He had realized that non-violence could not tackle the heights of the British barbarity.</p></li>
       <li><p id="para"> The death of Lala Lajpat Rai left a deep wound in his heart. He surged ahead to avenge it by assassinating John Saunders(mistaking him to be James Scott, who was actually responsible for his death). He was on absconding for months before he surrendered after the bombings at the Central Legistative Assembly. It was later found out that he was one of the assailant of John Saunders. He was convicted along with Rajguru and Sukhdev and eventually hung to death on 23<sup>rd</sup> March, 1931.</p></li>
       <li><p id="para">Recently, senior INC leader Manish Tiwari wrote a letter to the Prime Minister requesting to posthumously confer Bhagat Singh with the Bharat Ratna, which he should have got much earlier. He is already a "Ratna" in our hearts, this will make him one on paper too.</p></li>
